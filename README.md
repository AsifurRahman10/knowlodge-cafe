**Live Demo:** [Knowledge Cafe](https://luminous-paletas-05a01e.netlify.app/)

## Overview
Knowledge Cafe is a React-based project that implements core concepts of React such as state management, effect hooks, and fetching data from a local JSON file. The app allows users to browse blog posts, bookmark them for later, and track their reading progress.

## Features
- **Fetch Blog Data**: Blogs are fetched from a locally saved JSON file.
- **Bookmark Blogs**: Users can bookmark blogs to read later.
- **Mark as Read**: Blogs can be marked as read, which removes them from the bookmark list.
- **Reading Time Tracker**: The app tracks and displays the total reading time for blogs that have been read.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface and managing state.
- **JSON (Fake API)**: Blog posts are fetched from a local JSON file.
- **React Hooks**: For managing state (`useState`) and side effects (`useEffect`).
- **CSS/Tailwind (Optional)**: For styling the components.

Future Enhancements
Improve the UI for better user experience.
Add search or filter functionality for blog posts.
Optimize bookmark and read functionality for larger datasets.
